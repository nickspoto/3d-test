# 3d-test
Short project that I used to help visualize linear transformations in 3d space. I wanted to make it simulate movement similar to a first-person shooter. I used 3d rotation, scaling, and perspective matrices to assist in these graphics. Potentially, I could expand this into a larger project later.
